**VSCode, React, JavaScript,** React State, Events, Components
##
  
Overview: 
  
The Budget Planning application was created to help the user control his expenses.

The user can enter data of his expenses and the applications will automatically calculate how much he spent in a specific month and in a specific year.

By dynamically changing the chart, the user can see the visual difference between the months.

The user can delete unnecessary information by clicking on the button next to the data.

The application is created in VSCode using React with Javascript
